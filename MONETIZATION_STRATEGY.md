## Marketing Strategy to Hit Your Goal

### Phase 2: Growth (Week 3-8)

**Goal: 10,000-50,000 downloads**

1. **Google Ads** ($100-500 investment)
   - Target keywords: "HEIC converter", "iPhone photo converter"
   - Cost per install: $0.50-$2.00
   - $500 budget = 250-1,000 installs
   - ROI: If 3% convert, 7-30 sales = $15-$60 revenue
   - *Not profitable initially, but builds user base*

2. **App Store Optimization (ASO)** (FREE)
   - Optimize title: "HEIC to JPG Converter - Photo Format"
   - Keywords in description
   - Get 50+ 5-star reviews (ask users)
   - Better ranking = more organic downloads

## Maximizing Revenue Per User

### Increase Premium Conversion Rate

**Current: 3% (industry average)**
**Target: 5-10%**

**How:**
1. **Better onboarding**: Show value immediately
2. **Strategic prompts**: Ask to upgrade after 3rd conversion
3. **Limited-time offers**: "50% off for next 24 hours" ($1.49)
4. **Social proof**: "Join 10,000+ premium users"
5. **Feature comparison**: Show what they're missing

### Increase Ad Revenue

**Current: ~$1-2 per 1,000 impressions**
**Target: $3-5 per 1,000 impressions**

**How:**
1. **Add interstitial ads**: Full-screen after conversion
2. **Add rewarded ads**: "Watch ad to unlock 10 more conversions"
3. **Optimize placement**: Test different positions
4. **Better targeting**: Let AdMob learn user behavior

---

## Alternative: Subscription Model

**Consider changing to subscription after initial launch:**

Instead of $2.99 one-time, offer:
- **Weekly**: $0.99/week
- **Monthly**: $2.99/month  
- **Yearly**: $19.99/year (best value)

**Why this could be better:**
- Recurring revenue (more predictable)
- Higher lifetime value per user
- 100 subscribers at $2.99/month = $299/month = $3,588/year
- Only need 280 subscribers to hit $10,000/year

**Why stick with one-time:**
- Easier to sell ("lifetime access")
- Less churn (no cancellations)
- Better for utility apps (vs content apps)
